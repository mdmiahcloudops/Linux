## Super user (admin) : 

To switch back to root user(admin) on AWS linux:  

- `sudo -i` (AWS)  
- `sudo su` (AWS)  
  // Ec2-user does not have enough privilege so we need to make it root user by `sudo -i` or `sudo su` (super user do switch user - make me root user)  
- `su root` (Alma/ aws with root password)

> 💡 **Note:** All three commands provide root-level access and privileges, but `sudo -i` is best for fully getting the root’s environment and `su root` has to provide the root password.
